This project works with the King County House Sales dataset. The dataset has been modified to make it a bit more fun and challenging.  The dataset can be found in the file `"kc_house_data.csv"`, in this repo. 

The description of the column names can be found in the column_names.md file in this repository. As with most real world data sets, the column names are not perfectly described.

In this project, I clean, explore, and model this dataset with a multivariate linear regression to predict the sale price of houses as accurately as possible.
